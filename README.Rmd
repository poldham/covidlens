The COVID-19 Lens package makes 

The goal of covid19lens dataset package is to make the [Lens Patent Collection of Covid-19 patents](https://about.lens.org/covid-19/) created by Osmat Jefferson and the Lens team available to the R and wider patent analytics community. 

There are three types of data available in the Lens collections:

- patents
- scientific literature
- patent sequence data

You can view the datasets and file types at the collection repository at:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/collection.png")
```

This package bundles the data into two data frames for patents and literature that you can access and work with in R.

- The patents dataset consists of 43,075 patent publications (applications, grants, design patents) that are relevant to COVID-19, MERS and SARS and subjects such as respirators and surgical masks.
- The literature dataset consists of 66,233 scientific publications on the same subjects

Each of the datasets can also be explored interactively on the Lens by following the [links](https://about.lens.org/covid-19/) on the home page. You can also download the individual sets in JSON if you prefer that in your workflows. 

## Installation

Due to its size the package is not intended for CRAN but can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("poldham/covid19lens")
```

## Patent Data

When the package is installed, load the library and call the patents data frame.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(covid19lens)
library(tidyverse)

patents %>% 
  select(lens_id, publication_number, title)
  
```

The data in the patents table combines the data from the different datasets into one table. A short version of the file names is presented in the `dataset` column.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

patents %>% 
  count(dataset, sort = TRUE)
```

If you find a record of interest you can use the `lens_id` to upload the record(s) to the Lens (a free account is needed for that) to investigate further. 

### Literature Data

The Literature data frame is accessed in the same way. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

literature %>% 
  select(lens_id, title)
```

You can also access the source datasets as for the patents. The names are shortened versions of the file names. 


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

literature %>% 
  count(dataset, sort = TRUE)
```


## The Pipe

The package is tidyverse friendly and the %>% is included.
